# BLOGSITE APPLICATION

### This is an incomplete blogsite application developed with the following tools:

- `Next.js`
- `TailwindCSS`
- `Flask`
- `Flask-Migrate`
- `Flask-SQLAlchemy`
- `Flask-CORS`
- `PyJWT`
- `Flassger`

### Things to improve:

1. Finalize setup of user authentication in the frontend, to ensure authenticated\
   creation, deletion, and update of a blog record.
2. Cached frequently accessed records.
3. Maximizing SSR capability of `Next.js`.
4. Proper documentation for endpoint resources with `Flassger`.
5. Improve docker-image sizes.
6. Unit tests.
